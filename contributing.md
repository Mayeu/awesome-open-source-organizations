# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of
Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to
abide by its terms.

## Adding an Entry

Before adding an entry, ensure that the organization matches the expectation of
this list. It boils down to the fact that all software the company makes
money with is available under a Free/Libre license.

Here are some examples of organizations that do not qualify:

- Mozilla, because of Pocket being closed source
- Red Hat, an example of this is Ansible Tower that is proprietary
- GitLab, the license used for the enterprise version does not qualify as a
  Free/Libre license
- ownCloud, the paid enterprise add-ons are proprietary

Please note that **we are not trying to demonize** these organizations.
What we want to achieve is to highlight a certain way of making a living
through Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS).

Make sure that you:

1. Create one pull request per organization you want to add.
2. Name each pull request with 'Add ThisOrganizations', example: 'Add Feedbin'.
3. For each entry, you should provide:
   1. a link to the company page,
   2. how it was funded (see the legend), and a link to Crunchbase if applicable,
   3. A link to the repo(s) where the organization host its source code,
   4. And finally a short description of the tool, or the organization mission.

After that, your pull request will be reviewed, and hopefully accepted :)

## Helping to Review Pull Requests

I would like to try to have a handful of reviews per pull request, so if you
have some time to spare, please check them out and help review the changes.
:pray:

## Modifying or Removing an Entry

If you want to update the status, fix something, and/or discuss some changes,
you can either create a new issue or open a pull request with your changes.

**If you open a pull request, please open one pull request per company to
update or remove.**

## Thank you

Thank you for reading this far, and for taking the time to help build and
maintain this list. :pray:
