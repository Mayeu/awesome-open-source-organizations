# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of
Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to
abide by its terms.

## Adding an Entry

Before adding an entry, ensure that the organization match the expectation of
this list. It boils down to the fact that the software the company is earning
money from is available under a Free/Libre license.

Here are some example of organization that does not qualify:

- Mozilla, because of Pocket being closed source
- Red Hat, an example of this is Ansible Tower that is proprietary
- GitLab, the license used for the enterprise version does not qualify as a
  Free/Libre license
- ownCloud, the paid enterprise add-ons are proprietary

Please also remember, **we are not trying to demonize** those organizations.
What we want to achieve is to highlight a certain way of making a living
through Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS).

Then ensure you:

1. Create one pull request by organization you want to add.
2. Name each pull request with 'Add ThisOrganizations', example: 'Add Feedbin'
3. For each entry, you should provide:
   1. a link to the company page
   2. how it was funded (see the legend), and a link to Crunchbase if applicable
   3. a link to the repository-ies where the organization host its source code
   4. and finally a short description of the tool, or the organisation mission

After that your pull request will be reviewed, and hopefully accepted :)

## Helping to Review Pull Requests

I would like to try to have a handful of reviews per pull request, so if you
have some time to spare, please check them out and help review the change
:pray:

## Modifying or Removing an Entry

If you want to update the status, fix something, and/or discuss some changes.
You can either create a new issue, or open a pull request with your changes.

**If you open a pull request, please open one pull request per company to
update or remove.**

## Thank you

Thank you for reading this far, and for taking the time to help build and
maintain this list. :pray:
