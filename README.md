# Awesome Open Source Organization

Some organizations/companies commitment to open-source goes as far as releasing all their products as open-source software. There are other ways of making an undertaking profitable than keeping the code proprietary, locked, hidden.

The goal of this list is to highlight such organizations, which release everything they do under a licence that empowers the user of the product. This does not include "Open Core" products since part of the product is under a proprietary license.

Organizations selling hosting for their product are only admitted if the self-hosted version offers all the features the paid hosted version has.

Please help me grow this list :)
