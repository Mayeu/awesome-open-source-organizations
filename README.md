# Awesome Open Source Organisation

The goal of this list is to highlight organisations (in a broad meaning, it includes for-profit and non-profit) which are open sourcing everything they do under a licence that empowers the user of the product. This does not include "Open Core" products since part of the product is under a proprietary license.

Organizations selling hosting for their product are only admitted if the self-hosted version offers all the features the paid hosted version has.

Please help me grow this list :)
